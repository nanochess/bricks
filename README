Bricks, a paddle/ball game that fits in one boot sector (510 bytes)
by Oscar Toledo G. Nov/02/2019

It's compatible with 8088 (the original IBM PC)

If you want to assemble it, you must download the Netwide Assembler
(nasm) from www.nasm.us

Use this command line:

  nasm -f bin bricks.asm -l bricks.lst -o bricks.img
  nasm -f bin bricks.asm -Dcom_file=1 -o bricks.com


>> HOW TO PLAY <<

Press Left Shift to start the ball.

Press Left Ctrl to move to the left, and press Left Alt to move to the right.

Each brick scores for one point. To finish faster, try to get a streak of several bricks when the ball rebounds from brick to brick.

You have 4 balls to finish the courtyard.

Enjoy it!


>> ATTENTION <<
